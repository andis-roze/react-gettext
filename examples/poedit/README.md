# Poedit example

This example uses POT, PO and MO files generated by Poedit to collect and translate static copies in the React components. To make it working on your end you will been to make sure that you have [gettextjs](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gettextjs) (python package) installed on your computer. To do it you will need to run following command:

```
pip3 install gettextjs
```

## Start example

To launch this example on your computer, you will need to install all dependencies by running `npm i` in the example root folder and then start local dev server by running `npm start` command. After doing this you will be able to see it in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) page.

## Translations workflow with Poedit

Whenever you make a change in your static copy inside of your React components, you will need to update your po files and translations in it. You can find all po files in the `languages/LC_MESSAGES` directory. Use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) application to work with po files on your computer.

Once you finish updating your translations, you need to generate json files from mo files created by Poedit. To do it you will need to run `gettextjs --json ./ ./src/` command and it will convert all mo files into json files. Restart your local dev server and your translations will appear in your browser.
